data/train_instances contains the protein IDs used in cross-validation
data/test_instances contains the protein IDs used as a hold out set
data/folds contains splits used in 5-fold cross-validation based on train_instances
data/fasta FASTA files for train_instances and test_instances
data/predictions RBO-EPSILON predictions for the benchmark sets
